# User Story 3: Performance Trends Testing Guide

## Overview
User Story 3 enables teachers to track student performance trends by comparing multiple result sheets and analyzing the effectiveness of peer learning pairs.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria Met
- âœ… Teacher uploads second (or subsequent) result sheet for same class & subject
- âœ… System compares performance of weaker students before and after pairing
- âœ… Dashboard shows improvement trends per student and per pair

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Performance Comparison

1. **Setup Initial Session**
   - Go to "Student Pairing" tab
   - Upload `sample-data/class3a-math-session1.csv`
   - Generate pairs using any strategy
   - **Click "Approve All Pairs"** (This saves pairing history)

2. **Track Performance Changes**
   - Go to "Performance Trends" tab
   - Upload `sample-data/class3a-math-session2.csv`
   - Click "Save Session"
   - Select the first session as "Previous Session (Baseline)"
   - Click "Generate Trends Analysis"

3. **Expected Results**
   - Overview cards showing improvement/decline statistics
   - Detailed student-by-student comparison table
   - Color-coded improvement indicators
   - Risk level assessments
   - Actionable recommendations

### Scenario 2: Multiple Sessions Tracking

1. **Create Multiple Sessions**
   - Upload and save 2-3 different result sheets
   - Approve pairs for each session

2. **Compare Different Timeframes**
   - Use different baseline sessions for comparison
   - Observe how trends change over time

### Scenario 3: Real-World Testing

**Create your own test data:**
1. Create CSV files with same student names/IDs
2. Vary the marks to simulate:
   - Students improving after peer learning
   - Students declining (need attention)
   - Mixed results for different pairs

## ðŸ“Š Key Features to Test

### Performance Analysis Features
- **Student Improvement Tracking**: Individual progress for each student
- **Pair Effectiveness Analysis**: How well different pair types perform
- **Risk Level Assessment**: Automatic flagging of students needing attention
- **Trend Visualization**: Visual indicators for improvement/decline
- **Recommendations Engine**: AI-powered suggestions for next steps

### Data Management Features
- **Session Storage**: Automatic saving of performance sessions
- **Historical Comparison**: Compare any two sessions
- **Pairing History Integration**: Links performance to specific pair assignments

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Insights

### Student Level Insights
- Individual improvement/decline percentages
- Risk categorization (high risk, moderate risk, low performance, normal)
- Trend direction (upward, downward, stable)

### Pair Level Analysis
- Effectiveness of different pairing strategies
- Special analysis for high-low pairs (mentoring effectiveness)
- Overall pair improvement metrics

### Recommendations Examples
- "3 students showing concerning decline - Consider additional tutoring"
- "2 pairs not showing expected improvement - Review and potentially reassign"
- "5 pairs showing excellent results - Maintain these pairings"

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Data Overview

**Session 1 (Baseline):**
- 20 students, average: 69.1
- Range: 52-85 marks

**Session 2 (After peer learning):**
- Same 20 students, average: 72.4
- Most students show 3-6 point improvements
- Some students show significant gains (Diana: 59â†’65, Julia: 56â†’62)
- Few students show minimal or no improvement

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features

### Performance Tracking Engine
- **Smart Student Matching**: Matches students by ID or name across sessions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates averages, improvements, percentages
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated categorization based on performance patterns
- **Pair Effectiveness**: Links individual performance to pair assignments

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage Integration**: Persistent session and pairing history
- **Session Management**: Organized storage of multiple performance sessions
- **History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all performance comparisons

### User Experience
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant trend generation and visualization
- **Color-coded Feedback**: Intuitive visual indicators for all metrics
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear, specific recommendations for next steps
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes

## ðŸš€ Advanced Testing

### Edge Cases to Test
1. **Missing Students**: What happens if a student is in one session but not another?
2. **Identical Scores**: How are "no change" scenarios handled?
3. **Large Improvements**: Testing with dramatic score changes
4. **No Pairing History**: Performance analysis without saved pair data

### Integration Testing
1. **Cross-Feature Workflow**: Student Pairing â†’ Performance Trends â†’ repeat
2. **Data Persistence**: Refresh browser and ensure data is maintained
3. **Multiple Classes**: Test with different class/subject combinations

This comprehensive testing guide ensures User Story 3 meets all requirements and provides valuable insights for educators tracking peer learning effectiveness!
